        "\n",
        "### How Locally Weighted Regression (LWR) Works\n",
        "\n",
        "Locally Weighted Regression (LWR) is a non-parametric regression method that, unlike traditional linear regression, does not fit a single global model to the data. Instead, it fits a separate weighted linear regression model for each prediction point (query point). The core idea is to assign higher weights to data points closer to the query point and lower weights to points further away. This is typically achieved using a kernel function, such as the Gaussian kernel, where the `bandwidth` parameter controls the extent of locality.\n",
        "\n",
        "For a given query point `x_q`:\n",
        "1. **Calculate Weights**: Each training data point `x_i` is assigned a weight `w_i` based on its distance from `x_q`. The Gaussian kernel formula used is `w_i = exp(-(x_i - x_q)^2 / (2 * bandwidth^2))`. A smaller bandwidth means only very close points get significant weight, leading to a more 'wiggly' curve. A larger bandwidth gives more points significant weight, resulting in a smoother curve, potentially approximating a global linear regression.\n",
        "2. **Weighted Least Squares**: A linear regression model (`y = beta_0 + beta_1 * x`) is then fitted to the training data using these calculated weights. The coefficients `beta` are found by minimizing the weighted sum of squared errors.\n",
        "3. **Prediction**: The fitted local model's coefficients are used to predict the value for `x_q`.\n",
        "\n",
        "This process is repeated for every point for which a prediction is desired, making LWR computationally intensive for large datasets but highly flexible in capturing complex, non-linear relationships in the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights from Model's Predictions and Visualization\n",
        "\n",
        "The visualization clearly shows that the LWR curve effectively captures the trend in the house price data. Unlike a global linear regression that might struggle with non-linear patterns, LWR adapts locally to the data, providing a smoother fit that reflects the varying relationships between house size and price across different ranges. The chosen `bandwidth` of 200 seems to provide a good balance, avoiding excessive noise while still following the general upward trend with some curvature.\n",
        "\n",
        "The initial data points show a relatively steeper increase in price with size, which then appears to moderate slightly for larger houses. The LWR curve successfully mimics this behavior. This local adaptation is a significant advantage, as it does not force the entire dataset into a single, potentially inadequate, linear assumption.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Specific Prediction for 1400 sqft House\n",
        "\n",
        "Based on the Locally Weighted Regression model, the predicted price for a **1400 sqft** house is **51.32 lakhs**.\n",

        "This prediction is derived from a local model that considers the prices of houses similar in size to 1400 sqft more heavily than those far away, providing a prediction that is highly relevant to that specific region of the data."
